# Statistics

## Introduction


Welcome! This repository contains projects coded in Python aimed towards utilising statistics to unfold findings.
There are 3 parts to this repository; statistics_1, statistics_2 and statistics_3. In the subsequent paragraphs, each project will be explained and elaborated. 
Any form of feedback will be appreciated. Thank you for coming by. :) 
  
  
## [Statistics_1](statistics_1.ipynb)

Through analysing the datasheet on the weather, the aim of this project is to unearth if there is a possibility of a relationship between temperature and various factors.

Plotting a bar graph(Figure 1.1), the summary of the weather is on the x-axis and the temperature being the y-axis. It is clear that the summary of weather is related to the temperature. From Figure 1.1, when the weather is Dry, the temperature tends to be higher at above 25 degrees. In Cloudy weathers, the temperature tends to fall between 10 to 25 degrees, while Breezy and Foggy weathers have lower temperatures below negative 0 degrees. 

However, it is vauge to conclude that the summary of weather determines that the temperature will be of a certain range, albeit the clear association between the two factors. 

For example, from Figure 1.1, in Windy weathers the temperature falls below 8 degress while a Windy and Dry weathers falls above 25 degrees which is a significant differenece from just Windy weathers. 

Figure 1.2 shows that there is a negative correlation between Humidity and Temperature. the higher the Temperature, the lower the Humidity. The coefficient of correlation ranges from -1 to 1 which shows that there is a strong negative correlation.

In Conclusion. The temperature of the weather is affected by variosu factors such as the Humidity and the Summary of the weather.
